# Python-Neural-Networks-Library

### Repository Overview 

This repository serves as a curated collection of my notes on the second half of the "Machine Learning with Python Certification" course by freeCodeCamp. These were produced as part of my independent study in Python, and I am sharing these notes for use as a reference resource. The focus of this section of the course goes beyond TensorFlow with Python, delving into advanced concepts in deep learning.

The second half of the content explores practical applications and advanced techniques in machine learning. Topics covered include neural networks, recurrent neural networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), convolutional neural networks (CNN), natural language processing (NLP), and reinforcement learning. These materials aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of these concepts, making them accessible for learners at various levels.

This library consists of 4 PDF files, each corresponding to specific topics covered in the second half of the certification course. These offer insights into the principles behind neural networks, advanced deep learning techniques, and specialized areas such as NLP and reinforcement learning. They are clickable under the "Course Sections Covered" subheading, and more information about the course details is found in the Course Details below.

The first half of the content for this course covered TensorFlow in Python. My notes on the content for this are extensive and found in their sister repository [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/Python-TensorFlow-Library).
